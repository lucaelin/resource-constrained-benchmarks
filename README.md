# Resource Contrained Benchmarks

This benchmark attempts to compare different backend technologies in a resource
contrained environment. In a microservice setup, many services may deploy
simultaniously and compete for resources on a single node, especially in a
test-environment. The focus is on startup, warmup and throughput performance.
